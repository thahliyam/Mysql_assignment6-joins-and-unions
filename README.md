# Mysql_assignment6-joins-and-unions
This assignment focuses on performing SQL operations to retrieve and manipulate data using the Country and Persons tables. The tasks include applying various joins—INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN—to combine data from both tables in different ways, such as retrieving matching records only, all records from Persons with matches in Country, and all records from Country with matches in Persons. Additionally, the project involves listing distinct country names from both tables by removing duplicates, as well as listing all country names with duplicates retained. Finally, the task rounds the ratings of all persons in the Persons table to the nearest integer for simplified data representation.
